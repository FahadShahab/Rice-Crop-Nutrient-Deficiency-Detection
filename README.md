# Rice-Crop-Nutrient-Deficiency-Detection

This project aims to predict nutrient deficiencies such as Notrogen, Potassium and Phosphorus in rice plants using deep learning techniques. The dataset used, Nutrient-Deficiency-Symptoms-in-Rice, contains images of rice plants showing symptoms of various nutrient deficiencies.

To improve prediction accuracy, an ensemble model is employed, combining the outputs of five different deep learning models. This approach leverages the strengths of multiple models to provide a robust and accurate classification of nutrient deficiencies, which is crucial for effective crop management and optimization.
